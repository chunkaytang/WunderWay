title: Our Company Structure
---

We have naturally evolved to have a company structure that is very well suited to our business. Therefore we're resisting the temptation to make it more 'corporate' as we grow, and are instead recognising what we have, reinforcing it, and reaping the benefits.

This short video explains how our company is structured:

The key points are:

* Our structure looks more like a circle than a traditional pyramid.
* We all have our home in a country office - where our 'souls' live. There is no HQ.
* Each country office has an MD to provide management close to home.
* We may each have multiple roles to represent the work we do, and can add and drop roles over time.
* Project teams are put together by roles, and are borderless.
* The teams that serve our clients are closest to the action — so that’s where most power lives and decisions take place.
* We have a business support team of specialists to support those closest to the clients, but these people also have homes in country offices, and just collaborate globally to operate as a group.
* We have a leadership team to support and steer the business — but leadership is a role, and the leaders have other roles in the business too, with their homes in country offices.

Additionally, here's some background on why we feel that a traditional 'pyramid' company structure isn't right for us:

We're not the only ones talking about this kind of thing. Take a look at this presentation by Niels Pflaeging, the author of the book "Organize for Complexity":
