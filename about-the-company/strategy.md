title: Our Strategy
---

This is our shared group strategy. Each business unit will develop implementation plans to contribute towards this.

## Our ambition

**We will create a better working life by transforming the way business is done. We do this through nurturing growth and success in digital business.**

*We want to improve the lives of our colleagues, customers, communities and anyone involved with us. We believe the best way for us to do this is by offering flexible, rewarding and meaningful work to colleagues who deliver highly professional and successful work for our customers, and contributions to our communities. The ‘nurturing’ word is very important to us.*

## Where the company is headed

**By 2020 we’ll be a company with global reach & recognition for improving people’s working lives.**

*Global reach provides interesting challenges for our teams and full service for our customers. We will be known not only for our work in digital business but also for truly improving working life.*

## What we do

**We help customers transform their business using software applications.**

*We take customers’ businesses online, help them create new businesses or improve existing businesses. Our focus is building continuously improving applications to enable this transformation.
To be clear, we don’t do work that is non-digital, not critical for our customers, or that we don’t believe can succeed.*

## The way we do it

**Our core service offering includes consulting, service design, software development and support.
We do these in long-term collaborative partnerships by using a small core set of best of breed tools and processes we specialise in.**

*We help our customers to learn faster and create better solutions by understanding the end user.
We are open and transparent as an organisation, sharing best practices widely. Playing fair and being responsible is important for us. We work within our strong values and best practices.
We experiment, learn from others and improve best practices.*

## Who we do it for

**Large and medium size organisations with ambition and vision. The work we do with them is critical to their business.**
