We want to be known as the most expert, professional, open and collaborative company in the world.


# What?!
That's a really big long term goal (yes, it means out of all companies in the world!), so in the mid-term we want to achieve that same reputation as a web company in Europe, and in the short term as a Drupal company in Europe. We'll move step by step towards the big ambition.


# Why?
There are lots of very expert and professional companies, but they're often not very open or collaborative. There are lots of open and collaborative companies but they're often not very expert or professional.

It's the powerful combination of our four characteristics that will set us apart.

It's these characteristics that we believe clients want to hire us for, for their most important projects. We also believe the best people will enjoy working here as a direct result of these characteristics.

Having the best teams and the best clients will in turn make us an even better company.


# How?
Through developing the Wunderway of doing things in the company, working together to put it into action, and continuously improving.

So that we're all pulling together in the same direction we've identified a number of quality objectives. You can find out all about these in the [About](/about-this-site/) section.
