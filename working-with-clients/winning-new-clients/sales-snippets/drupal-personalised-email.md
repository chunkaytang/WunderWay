title: Drupal - Personalised Email
---

Data can be emailed out to subscribers and personalised to match their preferences. This creates a much better user-experience than sending general content that’s not applicable or interesting to those receiving it.

Personalising the data and recording how users interact with the site generates more opportunities to create single-click navigation, which improves a user’s experience and encourages them to return.

Personalised emails, saved searches, related content and suggested searches all reduce the clicks required to receive information or data. Combined with [Rules](/working-with-clients/winning-new-clients/sales-snippets/drupal-rules/) personalised emails can help improve conversions and return visits by making the content very specific to the individual.
