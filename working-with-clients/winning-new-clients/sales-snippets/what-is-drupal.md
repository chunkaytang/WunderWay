title: What is Drupal
---

We build our web projects on the open source Drupal content management system. It’s a proven platform deployed on many of the world’s largest websites including the White House, The Economist, Royal Mail and Eurostar.

Drupal is known for its modular design which allows projects to develop over time in a very flexible, future-proof way. It’s also known for its performance and security.

Above all, it provides a very user-friendly interface for content creators, editors and managers. It will be easy for non-technical users to make changes to the content on any part of the site at any time. One of our team members, Roy Scholten, is in charge of the UX core initiative for Drupal 8, which is due out this year and will improve user-friendliness still further.

The CMS provides the functionality to display products for selling online. Regardless of what you sell or the range of different products that you sell, the CMS provides the flexibility for managing these various types while utilising the right elements of content for cross selling, promoting, marketing and optimising.

Drupal’s modular design is also ideal for long life-spans for projects. New features can easily be added, and the application can be easily integrated with other systems.

We firmly believe in and support the technologies we use and promote. We employ very experienced staff who are active in the Drupal community.

You can browse our team members at [http://www.wunderkraut.com/people](www.wunderkraut.com/people) and there are links on developer profile pages to their profile on the Drupal.org website. You’ll be able to see how involved they are with Drupal and what contributions they’ve made.

You can also examine their code on the site and the support they provide, and see how long they’ve been developing with Drupal. It’s part of the natural openness and transparency of the Open Source community.

In terms of credibility for our platform and project approach, the UK Government is a big advocate of Drupal, Agile  and Open Source and they’re realising big savings from these. A recent blog post on the Cabinet Office website (which itself is built on Drupal) talks about saving millions of pounds by switching to Agile delivery methods and Open Standards.
