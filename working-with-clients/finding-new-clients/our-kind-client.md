title: Our Kind of Client
---

Good companies have a clear picture of the kind of people they want to recruit. We believe that great companies also have a clear picture of the kind of clients they want to win too.

This is best for everyone as it ensures the client receives the best service and results for them, and we get to work on projects that are a good match for our skills and ways of working.

A Wunder customer should:

* Be looking for a long term partnership rather than a one-off project.
* Be interested in working collaboratively rather than throwing a briefing document over the fence and waiting.
* Understand that launching a website is getting to the start line, rather than the finish line.
* See digital as core to the future of their business.
* Have hard problems to solve which need more than the usual agency pretty brochure-ware style approach.
* Be willing to work within our approach to delivery (unless they can show they deliver more successful web projects per year in a client/agency relationship than we do).
* Be willing to work in an open and transparent way.
* Have staff members that we would enjoy working with.
* Be a company we would be proud to say we work with.

To become a great company we should become very good at politely declining to work with clients who don't match this profile. This selectiveness will define us.
