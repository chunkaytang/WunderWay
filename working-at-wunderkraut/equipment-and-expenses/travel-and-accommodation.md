title: How to Book Travel & Accommodation
---

You'll more than likely need to travel to a client office, for a meetup in London or perhaps to one of our offices.

To book travel and accommodation you can either book it yourself and [submit an expenses](/working-at-wunderkraut/equipment-and-expenses/how-claim-expenses/) claim or you can email Nic who will gladly book and pay for you.

Where possible we recommend you booking in advance so that you can get better rates. However, some of us travel at short notice so that's not always possible.
