title: Peer performance review
---

We use peer performance review to help us understand ourselves, what we can improve, and what we can do to help each other more.

Every six months, you ask your buddy to collect performance feedback from three to five co-workers of your choice. Choose co-workers who will have gained insight from working closely with you recently.

Your buddy asks each of them three questions:

1. What you should keep doing
2. What you should start doing
3. What you should stop doing

Your buddy then identifies common trends and highlights important points and presents the anonymous feedback to you.

How you use this information is up to you.
