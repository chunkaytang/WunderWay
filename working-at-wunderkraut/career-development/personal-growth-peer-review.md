title: Personal growth peer review
---

We use peer review to provide perspective, to help us understand ourselves, how we can improve, and what we can do to help each other more.

Every six months, you can ask your buddy to collect feedback from three to five co-workers of your choice. Choose co-workers who will have gained insight from working closely with you recently.

Your buddy introduces your own goals to the co-workers. These can include:

1. Where do you want to be in five years
2. How can I be more open, professional, healthy, fluid, and a leader? See [our principles](/about-the-company/principles/)
3.

Your buddy collects answers to the following questions?

1. What you should keep doing to achieve these goals?
2. What you should start doing to achieve these goals?
3. What you should stop doing to achieve these goals?

Your buddy then identifies common trends and highlights important points and presents the anonymous feedback to you.

How you use this information is up to you, and it can help you make decisions in your [professional development plan.](/working-at-wunderkraut/career-development/professional-development-plan)
