title: Rationale of choosing HipChat

## Why did we choose HipChat?
The team that was assigned to choose the best chat app to adopt across the whole group evaluated a number of potential tools and it came down to a choice between two: HipChat and Slack.

## Slack vs. HipChat
The members of the team were made up of people who had been using HipChat and people who had been using Slack. Each pitched for their favourite to be chosen.

Slack is a new startup tool and has the new cool street cred that goes with that. HipChat is an old workhorse that’s well established from Atlassian (the makers of Jira).

## Criteria
To decide between them, a list was created with the functionality that we need to use, and both tools were scored. The result showed they could both do everything we need, and do it well. Both had extensive integrations and good APIs. Both had search. Both had UIs that clients could easily use. Both had apps for different platforms.

## Difference: Pricing
The only key difference was on pricing, Slack was going to cost us nearly $10,000 per year more than HipChat - so we had to find some advantage that would justify that extra cost, and we couldn’t. Being the new ‘cool’ startup thing wasn’t enough - we needed to see specific features or benefits that were actually useful.

So the evaluation was made based on assessment of the facts about the functionality.

## Continuous Evaluation
However, we’re on no long term commitment to HipChat (whereas we’d have had to sign to Slack for a year), so if we see other platforms become measurably better, we can move.
