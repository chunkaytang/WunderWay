The Wundertalks are Wunderkraut's weekly knowledge sharing webinar. 

This document tries to answer some of the common questions regarding the Wundertalks. If your questions are not answered here, please ask them in the “Wundertalks” HipChat channel.

## For viewers

### When do the Wundertalks take place?

Every Friday at noon for central Europe, 13:00 for Finnland and the Baltics and 11:00 in the UK.

### Where do I find the current or past episode?

If you are logged in with your company account, you can see all current and past episodes here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tbolFp-JIhdPRl59OW8PgN4l7Zl92uHYLe_wihJZBpU/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tbolFp-JIhdPRl59OW8PgN4l7Zl92uHYLe_wihJZBpU/edit).

### Who can view the Wundertalks?

The content is generally oriented towards internal use, but if the topic allows for it and if the speaker is not opposed we sometimes promote them to the outside of the company. We sometimes get requests from customers who asks if they can view, which we have always welcomed. 

### Where can I see upcoming topics?

Check the [WunderTalks schedule](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheets/d/1tbolFp-JIhdPRl59OW8PgN4l7Zl92uHYLe_wihJZBpU/edit).

### Who can participate?

Anyone who works at Wunderkraut. You don’t need to be an expert, you just need to have something to share. If you work from another company and you want to present something that would be relevant for us, please send an e-mail to florian.loretan@wunderkraut.com. 

### I’d like to participate, where do I sign up?

At the [WunderTalks sign-up page](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/forms/d/18y9SVhMXsi6Ewfy5AV4Yvjk2AUgYwO-3HNoDAkL8VFY/viewform)

## For presenters

### Format: short presentation

Each Wundertalk episode takes place at 12:00 GMT+1 on Friday and lasts about 30 minutes. There are 1-3 topics, with a time of 5-10 minutes allocated for each. The only guideline regarding content 
is that it should be interesting and relevant for your Wunderkraut colleagues.

### Technology: Hangout on Air

The Wundertalks are streamed using Google Hangout on Air. This system has a limit of 9 active participants (just like regular Google Hangouts), which in our case are the speakers and the moderator. The active participants have a real-time interaction which is recorded and streamed to the public page with about 30 seconds of delay. 

If you have used Google Hangouts before you don’t need to setup anything particular. If you haven’t you might need to [install the plugin](https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin).

The most common mistake is to forget to unmute yourself before starting to speak. **Make sure you are unmuted when you speak. Really.**

### Sound check

The moderator will start the Hangout on Air 10 minutes before the Wundertalk starts publicly and send an invitation to the presenters via HipChat, so make sure you are online and reachable. This is done to test that sound, video and screensharing work fine.

### Sensitive content

The Wundertalks are shared internally by default, but anyone with the link could watch (for example, if an employee shares the link to a specific episode), so ask for permission before talking about client projects. If you need to share lessons learned, make sure it doesn’t put anyone in a bad position. 

### Screensharing and fullscreen slides

If you want to share slides fullscreen, you need to share your desktop rather than sharing a specific window (otherwise, screensharing stops without notice when you go in full screen). Please take care to close or minimize unnecessary windows, these can be distracting or might show things you didn’t want to share. Using an external display can make it easier to have smooth transitions, put the hangout window on one screen, and the stuff you want to share on the other.

Under certain circumstances, screensharing will stop working. If that happens, close and reopen the Google Hangout window.

### Video or sound not working

If your video is not working (no video device in the google hangout settings), try closing skype or other programs that can use your webcam and restart the google hangout. If your problems persist, try again in a different browser.

### Copyrighted material

Please avoid the use of copyrighted material within your presentation. Youtube automatically detects such content and will block the video (bad) and put our account on probation, which disables Hangouts on Air (very bad).
