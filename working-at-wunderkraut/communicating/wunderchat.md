HipChat has been chosen (for why, see [our rationale of choosing HipChat](hipchat-rationale)) to help the Wunder team connect with each other and our customers in a simple way across all platforms. It allows 

* file sharing, 
* video calls and 
* 1-1 chat.

## Apps / Clients
You can access HipChat via a browser at [https://wunderchat.hipchat.com](https://wunderchat.hipchat.com) or via a desktop, mobile or tablet client app. Download HipChat apps from appstores for your device, and desktop apps at [https://www.hipchat.com/downloads](https://www.hipchat.com/downloads). 

## Internal support and onboarding
If you need help, just go into the room "WunderCafe", ask someone in your local office - or check the hipchat help. The HipChat help documentation is at [http://help.hipchat.com](http://help.hipchat.com) and can provide quick answers in many cases.

## Communication Etiquette
Anything in the Wunderchat rooms should be regarded as non-permanent, and not likely to be seen by everyone in the room. If you need a permanent record of something being communicated, or you need to ensure everyone sees it, then email should be used rather than chat. That also means you have no obligation to keep checking all the backscroll in rooms you belong to. No-one expects you to read everything.

### Watercooler Conversations
There is a ‘Wundercafe’ room which is just for general chat on anything. It’s the place to go to hangout with everyone, share thoughts.

### Clients
Most rooms have clients in, including the Wundercafe (which is open access). This means we always need to be careful to represent ourselves well. Always speak as if a client can overhear you.

## Rooms
We can create any rooms that we like, both private and open. These can be for general chat or more focussed conversation about projects, country offices or communities of interest (eg Frontend, Agile, Drupalcon Amsterdam etc).

### Naming Conventions of Rooms
Feel free to create new rooms, but there are naming conventions to make them easy to find and understand:

* Project chat rooms should be named ‘*Project: Project Name’ - these rooms are for collaborating on delivery of a project
* Sales chatrooms should be named ‘!Sales: Opportunity Name’ - these rooms are for collaborating on RFPs, pitches etc
* Community chatrooms should be named ‘&Community: Community Name’
* Country chatrooms should be named ‘+Country: Country Name’
* Office chatrooms should be named ‘-Office: Office Name’

Feel free to propose other conventions for different types of room.

### Room's Privacy Settings
Any room that is public can be accessed by **any client staff member** who is added to the system. It’s ok for rooms to be public by default - this means any clients can wander in, but it can be good for them to see how we work and how open we are. But it’s **not ok for clients to see things about other clients**, so any client, sales or project rooms will need to be set to private. 

Any staff member can access any room. There are no rooms that are locked down to just a few staff members.

All Wunder staff are admins in HipChat so you can access any room and add new rooms, users etc. Please do not use other admin functions such as adding integrations. 

Please add client project teams as users and members of the project room, and encourage them to take part in the project chat.

## Users

### Create new users: staff (internal)
You need to have the role *Admin* to create a new user. Then follow these steps:

1. Open the *User Administration* in HipChat (Menu *Group Admin* --> *Users*)
2. Add new user with the following values:
  * Full Name: Firstname Lastname
  * @mention name: firstnamelastname
  * Email: the user's email address
  * Role: *User* or *Admin* (usually we prefer *Admin* and trust our team to be responsible)
4. Invite the team member to our room *WunderCafe* and welcome her/him

### Create new users: customers and partners (external)
There are two ways to add external partners to HipChat: either create a HipChat user or use the *Guest Access* feature of HipChat.

#### Create a HipChat User for external partners
Just follow the steps above, but consider the changes in step 2.:

* Full Name: Firstname Lastname Company
* @mention name: firstnamelastnamecompany
* Email: the user's email address
* Role: *User*

By the additional information about the user's company, it is easier to differentiate between our staff and our external partners. And by granting the role *User* we guarantee that a user can only access the private rooms only with an invite and all public rooms. 

#### Guest Access
*todo*

## Integrations
HipChat has a great API, and can be integrated with many other tools. If you would like an integration set-up then contact @stevehunton @alicerichmond or @joebaker please.

## Video chat and screensharing
The 1-1 conference feature is really handy for quickly hopping on a video chat with someone and collaborating. It’s really good quality. 

There is now also support for adhoc video conferences. To start one just type */hangout* or */appear* to invite others to a hangout or appear.in conference and provide the link.

## Cato
There is a bot called @cato who can be very helpful (reporting in from github, jenkins etc), but can also be lots of fun. There is a room called Cato’s Cupboard where you can experiment. Type ‘@cato help’ to see a list of what you can do.

## Speak up
Work out loud. We’re a distributed company, so it’s great to keep everyone in the loop with where you are, what you’re working on etc. Say hi in the relevant rooms when you start the work day, and say bye before you finish for the day. That really helps to build a sense of community across borders.
