## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
As a rule of thumb, we adhere to the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org), which states - besides others - “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”. 
In most of our projects, we have to consider the highly remote setup. Within these circumstances, interactions between individuals are not always to be considered (and efficient) to be face-to-face. According to this, in order to discuss issues and reach mutual agreement, we prefer the following communication channels in their given order:

* In person conversation
* Call (Skype/[WunderChat - HipChat](wunderchat), phone, VOIP)
* Text chat ([WunderChat - HipChat](wunderchat))
* Persistent documentation system (Ticket / Issue system, CRM, etc.)

If not documented by the nature of the [communication channel](communication-channels), any relevant results of discussions must then be documented within an appropriate, persistent system.

## Commitment

* If I address a person, I will expect an answer.
* If I’ve asked for something, I confirm that I’ve read the answer and confirm that this helped/resolved my issue.
* If I’ve asked for something and things/circumstances change, I will send a notfication ASAP.
