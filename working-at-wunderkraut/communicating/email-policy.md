This policy details the framework within which Wunderkraut supports the use of email.
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that email is used effectively across Wunderkraut.

This policy contains important rules covering email. Many of the rules apply equally to Wunderkraut’s other methods of external communication such as letter, the use of fax and telephone.
This document forms part of Wunderkraut’s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

### Definitions of suspicious emails

Spamming - Spam is unsolicited commercial email, the electronic equivalent of the junk mail that comes through your letterbox.

Phishing - Phishing is the use of bogus emails and websites to trick an email user into supplying confidential and personal information.

Chain Letters - A chain letter is an electronic email that urges you to forward copies to other people.

### Responsibility
* All Staff using Email.
* It is the responsibility of all staff to comply with this policy.

Email users should be aware that they neither own the documents that they or their colleagues create, nor have intellectual property rights therein.

### Operational system

#### When to use Email
It is the responsibility of the person sending an email message to decide whether email is the most appropriate method to communicate the information. The decision to send an email should be based on a number of factors including:

* The subject of the message
* The recipient’s availability
* The speed of transmission
* The speed of response required
* The number of recipients of the email
* The Classification (‘sensitivity’) of information contained within the email

### Writing Work Related Email Messages

When writing a work related email message it is important that consideration is given to the way in which the message is conveyed.This includes thinking about the title, the text and the addressees.

Email messages constitute a formal record and can be used as evidence in legal proceedings.

### Personal Use

Wunderkraut defines reasonable personal use as ‘transactions of personal affairs’ which cannot be avoided during working hours.

Staff who have access to email for business purposes may make reasonable personal use of email facilities provided by Wunderkraut provided that it:

* does not interfere with the performance of your duties;
* does not overburden the system;
* does not create any additional expense to the organisation.

The conditions of this policy also apply to use of personal email.

### Security

Each Email account, whether a personal or group account, is protected by access control measures i.e. username and password requirements.

Individual users must take personal precautions to ensure the security of their email account including logging off from their laptop before leaving it unattended and implementing 2-step authentication on Gmail accounts. This will prevent others reading your email or sending a potentially embarrassing hoax message in your name.

Archiving: The storing of personal data (within the meaning afforded to it with the Data Protection Act 1998) is subject to the same controls as any other personal data, and is therefore subject to Freedom of Information requests. Here is a link to the [data protection act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act)

Virus Protection: The most common way of receiving a computer virus is through email. Software has been installed on the Email servers which scans each email attachment for embedded viruses as soon as it enters the Network.

At individual level it is the responsibility of all email account holders to:
* delete any messages from unknown origin;
* immediately delete any emails that have been misdirected or forwarded incorrectly, this includes any message that is not directly addressed for your attention

Forwarding emails: Users should be mindful of any email trail that is contained within any forwarded emails. This information may be sensitive or contain information that is unsuitable for wider distribution. All email history contained within a forwarded email should be carefully reviewed and editing before sending.

### Misuse and Abuse of Email

The sending of email which can or does cause distress will be dealt with appropriately.

Behaviour or comments that are not permitted in the spoken or paper environment are not permitted in email messages.

Email messages containing inaccurate information in the form of opinion or fact about an individual or organisation, may result in legal action being taken against the person sending the email message and anyone forwarding the email message on to others.


### Housekeeping

It is the responsibility of all members of staff to manage their email messages appropriately. It is important that email messages are managed in order to comply with Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation.

Emails must be deleted on a regular basis – this includes inbox, sent items and deleted items.

### Unsolicited Email (spamming)

Wunderkraut is protected from ‘spamming’ by Google and Wunderkraut users can setup filters both of which can prevent unsolicited mail.

“SPAM” Mail can be avoided by the following:

* If you don’t know the sender delete the email
* Never respond to spam or click on links within it
* Never give your email address on the internet
* Only give your email address to people you trust
* Use the ‘bcc’ field if you email many people at once
* Never make a purchase from unsolicited email
* Use the ‘report spam’ option to blacklist the email address

### Hoaxes, Scams & Chain Letters

If you receive any form of the above in emails do not forward them to anyone, delete them immediately and select the ‘report spam’ option in Gmail.

### Sending email attachments

To prevent data leaks or information being stored in email servers which can compromise its security email attachments should be treated in the following manner:-

Email attachments should not contain any personal data or sensitive documents, this includes databases, credit card information, confidential documents, documents including names and addresses or sensitive security information.
If files are to be sent via email attachment they should zipped and encrypted, optional access keys added and custom expiration dates applied dependent on the document.
Passwords should be communicated separately via alternative means of contact

Many Email servers are designed to reject emails with attachments therefore the risk of an email not making it to the recipient is high, secure file transfer systems should always be used as priority when supplying or receiving information.

### Digital signatures

If a digital signature is required for a contract or written document, a secure signature program should be used. Wunderkraut utilise [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.net/MEMBER/MemberLogin.aspx) to do this confidentially and securely.

Docusign maintains an archive of signed documents.

### Summary
* DO protect the Security and Confidentiality of the system and information

* DO NOT misuse or abuse the system
* DO NOT email anything that could result in criminal or civil prosecution, or which could lead to disciplinary proceedings against you
