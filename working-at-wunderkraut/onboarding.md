When new people join our team it's important that they all receive the same warm welcome. If you've been chosen to welcome the next intake then here's a handy list to help you with your warm welcome.

## Before Joining
* Create a Staff folder using the [template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgWVJLdmxHX0wzSUU) in the same folder
* Get contracts signed digitally via DocuSign and store in the staff folder

Send an email to Finance to let them know the person's name, start date, salary and contact number/email. Finance will handle payroll
