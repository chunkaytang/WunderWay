There is lots written in the press about the health risks related to sedentary jobs. In a job like our it's all too easy to spend the whole day sat down. In a bid to fix this, to encourage each other to move a little more and to build on our team spirit we came up with the idea of WunderFitness.

Strava club
-----------

There's lots of good fitness websites and apps out there. One that's great for social aspects, device support and data nerds is [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), and it's getting used by more and more people. 

Strava's great for setting yourself goals and seeing your improvements on your regular routes. It's great for tracking cycling, running and swimming. It's completely free to use - woop! There is a Premium membership, but that's really only useful for people who're getting very serious and into racing, and what's available to free accounts is superb. 

We've created a 'club' on Strava: [www.strava.com/clubs/wunder](https://www.strava.com/clubs/wunder)
