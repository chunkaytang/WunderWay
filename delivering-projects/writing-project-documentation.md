Documentation is dull, so the idea goes, and often this principle from the Agile Manifesto seems to be read as if project documentation can be overlooked. Documentation, though, is frequently vital when adding new members to a project team, or when handing a project over from one team to another.

*Writing project documentation needn't be boring!*

Here's some principles and ideas for good project documentation.

Write a 'developer orientation' guide
-------------------------------------

You will need to add new developers into your project at some point, and it's important to get them up-and-running as quickly as possible with understanding why you're building what you're building, and how you're building it.

Here's some headlines for the sections in your developer orientation guide.

### Project summary

This section might include:

- **Client summary/Our customer**
  - Name the client and describe them in 1-3 lines.
- **Project summary/project goal**
  - Describe the main objectives and goals of the project or website in a couple of paragraphs. You may like to include:
    - Project mission
    - The client's organisational objectives
    - Key concerns, such as security, or performance
    - 
- **Project team**
  - List the key team members, both from Wunder and from the client, including any necessary contact details (bearing in mind keeping that sensitive data secure)
- **Supporting documentation**
  - Include a simple list for locating key project documentation, e.g.
    - Google Drive project folder
    - Proposal documents
    - Project plan

### Project management tools

- **Project tracking**
  - Indicate the project tracking tool (e.g. Rally, JIRA, PivotalTracker, etc.)
- **Source revision control**
  - Briefly describe:
    - the code versioning platform (Git, Subversion, etc.)
    - where to find the code repository
    - the privacy level 
    - how to gain access to it
    - the respository branching structure
    - the code development workflow approach (e.g. forks, pull requests, etc.)
