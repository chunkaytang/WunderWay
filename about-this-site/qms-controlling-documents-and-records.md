As the WunderWay is a living, breathing reference of what we do and how we do it, it's important that we control the way changes are dealt with. 

##WunderWay Change Requests

Changes are raised either as pull requests or issues in GitHub. Those changes are reviewed weekly and implemented when necessary. 

When we implement changes to the WW then we affect the whole group so be sure to consider the change you're making. If you've tried out a new process or tool locally then include the results of your test in the pull request or issue so that we can make decisions on the change requests more easily. Plus, it's good to keep a record of the reasons for change in GitHub so we can refer back later on.

If you're not sure about how to go about requesting a change then take a look at [How to edit the WunderWay](/about-this-site/how-edit-wunderway/). Try to be as descriptive as possible.

All changes will follow this simple process

<ul>
	<li>Review and prioritise the changes requests once per week</li>
	<li>Changes are reviewed with designers/developers/managers/sales as appropriate to identify:
	<ul>
		<li>Do we really need a change (if this was the result of a non-conformity does it really need a change or would a document or training do the job?)</li>
		<li>Is it urgent or can it wait?</li>
		<li>If we make the change, how will it affect others? Will we need to provide training?</li>
		<li>What's the value of the change</li>
		<li>What new documentation or tools does this require?</li>
		<li>Does this affect the management reviews or internal audits?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Plan how we implement the change
	<ul>
		<li>Who is responsible?</li>
		<li>When do we implement?</li>
		<li>Notify affected staff of the changes before it's implemented</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Carry out the implementation</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Documents updated</li>
		<li>Document versions updated and archived</li>
		<li>Make a note about the implementation in the pull request and close it</li>
		<li>Email to staff to advise that the changes are live</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

## Control of Documents

### Project Document Templates

The documents referred to within this document are based on templates. All project document templates are stored in Google Drive under:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZXBLTWJSZHZDU3M">WunderRoot Client Projects > ! Repository Template</a>

This repository template and all the documents within it will be copied at the start of every client project. It contains all of the **up to date versions of each document together with a recognised project document structure**.

### General Document Templates

General document templates are stored in Google Drive under:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgd1Q5aHpWS0hQRFU">WunderRoot > WunderRoot QMS</a>

### Managing Document Templates

Changes to document templates is a change to the QMS. Any changes must first be raised in the QMS Change Request Backlog and approved before being implemented.

When amending a template:

<ol>
	<li>Make a copy of the most recent version of the template.</li>
	<li>Amend the title of the document to include the latest version number.</li>
	<li>Move the version being replaced into the Archive sub-folder within that folder.</li>
	<li>Update the QMS Change Request Log to show the date of implementation, the version number and to record any notes necessary.</li>
</ol>

## Control of Records

### Project Records

All project records will be stored in the client project folder that is located at <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgTXRkV0FoYndDMWs">WunderRoot Client Projects</a>.

The structure of the client document repository is a direct copy of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZXBLTWJSZHZDU3M">Repository TEMPLATE folder</a>.

All document names will remain the same as the template, including the version but dates in the filename (where applicable) will follow the format provided. Dates generally apply to meeting notes.

All ad-hoc project documents (e.g. technical documentation) should be given a readable name where possible and added to the relevant project folder.

The folder storing the project documentation will be made available to all of those included in the project to promote transparency and openness.

If any changes are required to documents used for projects they must follow the Quality Management Change Request Procedure (see top of this page).

Sprint sign-off documents are issued and signed digitally using <a href="https://eu1.docusign.net/Member/Home.aspx">DocuSign</a>. A copy of the document is stored in the project repository under Reviews & Assessments > Signed.

Project contracts are issued and signed digitally using <a href="https://eu1.docusign.net/Member/Home.aspx">DocuSign</a>. A copy of the signed contract is stored in the project repository under Contracts > Signed.

### Non Project Documents

Document required by the business for managing non-project related matters are referred to in the procedures through this document. Most are maintained within Google Drive - <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgQmh6UkRnNC16ekE">WunderRoot</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZkdzVWFBbzZVS28">WunderRoot Management</a> folders. Documents relating to procedures should be linked to from within the project and operational processes described in this wiki.

Changes to any of these documents must follow the Quality Management System Change Procedure (see top of this page).
