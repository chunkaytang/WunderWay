title: (Formerly known as) Quality Management System (QMS)
---

When Wunderkraut was first born we decided that we needed a focus that would set us apart from a crowded market and provide the foundations on which to build a fantastic business that really worked. Our focus was on:

- Quality products
- Quality services
- Risk management
- Happy staff
- Happy clients

To do this properly meant a lot of effort. To make that effort worthwhile and to prove our quality credentials we decided to develop our processes in line with the quality management standard, ISO9001.

Everything we do is focused on our quality objectives. See [Our Quality Objectives](/about-this-site/quality-management-system/quality-objectives/) and [Our Quality Policy and Scope](/about-this-site/quality-management-system/quality-policy/).

The term Quality Management System is inherited from ISO9001 but we just need to see it as the way we do things within the business. The QMS used to be a single document (see [QMS History](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgUWFYWHc1Y2V4Rzg)) but then we decided that it just didn't work in that format. That was when we moved to the WunderWay.

If you need to know how we work, how to claim expenses or anything else, we now document all our processes on the WunderWay.

There is still a QMS document but it's been massively trimmed and simply refers to the WunderWay. See [WR Quality Management System v1.5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AHgYft2MHbD1c_FjgBQ1mx9w9CGQgDQFL5OPhdgoRA/edit)
